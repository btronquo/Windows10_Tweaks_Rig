# Windows10_Tweaks_Rig
### Tweaks for Rigs with Windows 10 x64

### Infos
For your information, the original script is made by jsanzsp (ethereum community) - Thanks to him!    
I decided to maintain this script and modify/add/remove some tweaks to have the best mining rig possible.

### How it works?
The batch file when started, ask you if you want to remove some natives funtionnalities of windows wich there are useless and dangerous for mining rig. Example: Windows update... you don't want that your rig reboot in the middle of the night and install 200+ updates right ? 

### Usage
> Download, right click with administrative privileges > chose what you want to be turned off > that's all!


# Enjoy!
